title = "More Chaos Wastes Boons";
description = "Adds (selected) talents and passives from all careers into list of boons that you can obtain as any career.
For example, you can now obtain BW's famished flames on IB,
Or WHC's killing shot (crit headshots insta kill) on Pyromancer
and more goofy combinations

21/5/2024 updated with 
- added Blur (shade's parry stealth passive) to list of obtainable boons
- removed combinations of careers and boons that cause either crashes or have no effect for the given hero (max ammo, reload speed boons on Sienna for example)
- had to disable blur fx to prevent crashes
- added Peregrinaje as dependency to prevent crashes due to mod load order";
